# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of the current project is for the web app to include all four of the hemisphere images utilizing BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars' hemispheres and image titles, store the scraped date on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accomodate the images.
